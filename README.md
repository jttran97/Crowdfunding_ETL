# Description 
This project utilizes Python, Pandas, Python dictionary, and RegEx to build an ETL pipeline to extract and transform data. After transforming the data, we had created four CSV files to create an ERD and an SQL schema. The data was then uploaded into Postgres database by uploading the four CSV files. 

# Data Modeling
